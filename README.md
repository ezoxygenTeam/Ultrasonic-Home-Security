# Ultrasonic Home Security

Ultrasonic Home Security is designed to enhance home safety by detecting specific frequency signal strengths using ultrasonic frequency domain analysis. When the signal strength exceeds a predetermined threshold, it is interpreted as an 'on' or 'off' signal, essentially a Boolean true or false concept. For instance, when a frequency is activated and surpasses the set threshold, the system defines this state as 'activated'. This algorithm can be applied to home security control. For example, when a door or window opens, our device emits a specific frequency signal to our receiver. Upon decoding this signal, the receiver sends out an email alert to the user, warning of a potential security breach in their home.

# What is the Ultrasonic Home Security feature?

### **Ultrasonic Frequency Detection**:  
- Monitors safety by detecting signal strengths at specific frequencies.
### **Boolean Signal Processing**:  
- Treats signals exceeding the set threshold as an on/off switch.
### **Home Security Application**:  
- Controls security through signal detection, such as sending alerts when doors or windows open.
### **Instant Alert Notifications**:  
- Automatically sends email alerts to users when anomalies are detected.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps for an optimal experience with our system:

1. **Open Website and Authorize Microphone**
   - Visit the website and agree to microphone permissions.

2. **Prepare Your Phone or Ultrasonic Transmitter**
   - Ensure your smartphone or ultrasonic transmitter is ready.

3. **Start the Microphone**
   - After preparing your phone, click `Start Microphone`.
   - **Note**: If you need the email function, please enter your email and activate `Start send Email`.

4. **Set Specific Frequency**
   - Set the name, threshold, and duration before an alert is needed for a specific frequency.

5. **Move the Transmitter to Detect Changes**
   - You can move the transmitter closer or further from the receiver to detect changes on the screen.
   - **Note**: When a specific frequency exceeds the threshold, the grey square on the screen will turn green.
