# Ultrasonic Home Security

Ultrasonic Home Security is designed to enhance home safety by detecting specific frequency signal strengths using ultrasonic frequency domain analysis. When the signal strength exceeds a predetermined threshold, it is interpreted as an 'on' or 'off' signal, essentially a Boolean true or false concept. For instance, when a frequency is activated and surpasses the set threshold, the system defines this state as 'activated'. This algorithm can be applied to home security control. For example, when a door or window opens, our device emits a specific frequency signal to our receiver. Upon decoding this signal, the receiver sends out an email alert to the user, warning of a potential security breach in their home.

# What is the Ultrasonic Home Security feature?

### **Ultrasonic Frequency Detection**:  
- Monitors safety by detecting signal strengths at specific frequencies.
### **Boolean Signal Processing**:  
- Treats signals exceeding the set threshold as an on/off switch.
### **Home Security Application**:  
- Controls security through signal detection, such as sending alerts when doors or windows open.
### **Instant Alert Notifications**:  
- Automatically sends email alerts to users when anomalies are detected.
